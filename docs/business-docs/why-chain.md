# Why Chain

Chain is an app designed for entrepreneurs and freelancers. The main purpose of the application is giving to that people a tool simple and colourful.
With Chain, people can make their business accounting at the same time they take control of the administration of their business. Also, Chain pretends to change the way administration is made to open doors to the young people who use to make things all on their mobile phones.

We want to simplify the processes in order to allow you to be empowered at your business and forget the things that you don't to be concentrated on, like:  make invoices, charge your customers, pay your bills, etc.

Usually is not easy to start a business, or being a freelancer. This is because we don't have financial education in life and even at school. When you start on your own, is difficult to focus on what matters if you need to study and have your fiscal stuff done.
